## Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructionsless 

In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

## Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructionsless 

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
